To Whom it May Concern,

Is there any way to search the Press or Sun-Bulletin headlines from the years 1934, 35, and 36.
My dad use to tell us this story of how he was hitckhiking home to Binghamton for the weekend, 
from the Corning area, from working at a CC camp in VanEtten.  
He was picked up by a man and a women on route 17 and dropped off at the Arch in Johnson City.
He said the man pulled out a gun and pointed it at him.  
The woman who was driving said put it away John, you are scaring the boy.  
My dad was somewhere between 14 and 16 at the time.  
My dad didn't say anything to anyone that night when he got home, 
but the next morning in the paper, the headlines stated that John Dillinger had passed 
through town, stopping at a local hotel, and the police were in pursuit.
